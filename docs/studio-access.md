# Studio Access & Role Assignment

This guide explains how to invite team members to the Sanity project and set their roles.

## ACTION REQUIRED FROM PM

### 1) Invite a user

1. Go to https://www.sanity.io/manage and open **Music 4 All**.
2. In the top nav, click **Members**.
3. Click **Invite member**.
4. Enter their email address.
5. Choose a role:
   - **Admin**: full access
   - **Editor**: publish/edit content
   - **Contributor/Viewer**: use for **Reviewer** (draft-only)
6. Click **Send invite**.

Screenshot callout: “Members” is in the top navigation bar.

### 2) Verify access in Studio

1. Ask the user to log in at:
   `https://music-4-all-delta.vercel.app/studio`
2. Confirm they can see the correct content types and cannot publish if they are a Reviewer.

## Mapping to workflow roles

- **Admin** → full control
- **Editor** → publish + approve content
- **Reviewer** → use **Contributor** (or **Viewer** if you want read-only)

If you want stricter in‑Studio permissions (e.g., hide publish actions), tell me and I can add custom Studio role rules.
